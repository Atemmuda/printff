# printf
## Concept
* Group Projects
* Pair Programming - How To
* Flowcharts
* Technical Writing

## Description
This team project is part of the first sprint of ALX SWE program. _printf replicates the C standard library printf() function.

What you should learn from this project:

* How to use git in a team setting
* Applying variadic functions to a big project
* The complexities of printf
* Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow

## Tasks
0. Write a function that produces output according to a format.

* Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
* Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
* write output to stdout, the standard output stream
* format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more  detail. 
1. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
    1. _c_
    2. _s_
    3. _%_
    4. _You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function_
    5. _You don’t have to handle the flag characters_
    6. _You don’t have to handle field width_
    7. _You don’t have to handle precision_
    8. _You don’t have to handle the length modifiers_
